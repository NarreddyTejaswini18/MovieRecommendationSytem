# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

This project is a hybrid **Movie Recommendation System** built using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. It leverages both **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering** to provide smarter, sentiment-aware movie recommendations.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The system uses metadata and credits from the TMDB 5000 dataset to recommend movies. It integrates:
- TF-IDF vectorization of movie overviews
- Cosine similarity for content-based filtering
- TruncatedSVD for collaborative filtering simulation
- Sentiment-based rating adjustment for enhanced recommendations

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Preprocessing of movie and credit data
- âœ… Content-based recommendation using NLP
- âœ… Collaborative filtering using matrix factorization
- âœ… Sentiment adjustment to refine ratings
- âœ… Interactive visualizations using Plotly and Seaborn

## ðŸ§° Technologies & Skills Used

- **Programming:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (TruncatedSVD, SelectKBest, f_regression)
- **NLP:** TF-IDF Vectorizer, Sentiment-aware overview processing
- **Recommendation Techniques:** Content-based filtering, Collaborative filtering, Cosine similarity
- **Data Preprocessing:** MinMaxScaler, Feature selection
